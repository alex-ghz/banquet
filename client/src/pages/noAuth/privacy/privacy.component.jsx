								<li className="bullet-elm">Background check and identity verification: We collect background check and identity verification information for drivers and delivery persons. This may include information such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Banquet’s behalf. We also collect identity verification from Banquet Eats users who request alcohol delivery.</li>
								<li className="bullet-elm">Demographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, including through user surveys. In some countries, we may also receive demographic data about users from third parties.</li>

							<ul className="bullet-lst">
								<li className="bullet-elm">Enabling dynamic pricing, in which the price of a ride, or the delivery fee for Banquet Eats orders, is determined based on constantly varying factors such as the estimated time and distance, the predicted route, estimated traffic, and the number of riders and drivers using Banquet at a given moment.</li>
								<li className="bullet-elm">Matching available drivers and delivery persons to users requesting services. Users can be matched based on availability, proximity, and other factors.</li>
								<li className="bullet-elm">Deactivating users who are identified as having engaged in fraud or activities that may otherwise harm Banquet, its users, and others. In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Banquet’s referral program, such behaviour may result in automatic deactivation.</li>
								<li className="bullet-elm">Using driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine by using such information that a driver is delaying a rider pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the rider a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver to omit such a fee. To object to such adjustment, please contact Banquet customer support.</li>
